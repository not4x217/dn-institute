"""Resolve quarantined rows against authoritative sources.

The chain answers transaction facts: whether a transaction exists and is
final, and its block time. It knows nothing about trades, which are the
indexer's reading of a transaction's logs, so trade counts come from decoding
the transaction afresh, independent of the feed that delivered the row. Trade
content (wallet, side, amount) is the indexer's responsibility and is trusted,
as it is for clean rows.

Both sources are behind the ChainResolver interface. This package ships only
NoOpResolver, which can't answer anything, so rows stay quarantined; a real
implementation would query a node or indexer.
